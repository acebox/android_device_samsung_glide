Samsung SGH-I927 (Galaxy Captivate "Glide") device tree for CM9/ICS 4.0.x

This device tree is very EXPERIMENTAL with focus on getting CM9 built and functional with the device.
This revision is based off the AOSP-ZEUS/android_device_samsung_n1 (i9103) tree by 
dman3285 (https://github.com/AOSP-ZEUS/android_device_samsung_n1) and used as a "skeleton".

What works:
-Sound, adapted libaudio from The-Covenant
-Phone calls, defined ril_class and with above libaudio
-Bluetooth, tested with BT speaker and OBD2 scanner.
-ADB
-Wi-Fi (5 + 2.4GHz)
-SMS/MMS
-Data on 4G/LTE/3G/EDGE (no Phone calls)
-Sdcard/Internal storage mounting (vold.conf)
-Screen on/off
-Screen touch input
-Screen auto-dimmer
-Proximity sensor
-Physical keyboard (except a few "special" keys)

What doesn't (yet):
-Keyboard Backlight
-Probably more, could use more testing.

Notes/TODO:
-UCLJ3 supports the following locales: de_DE en_GB en_US es_ES fr_FR it_IT, this will probably be the minimum I'll include as base.
